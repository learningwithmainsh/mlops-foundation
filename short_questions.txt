Q.1.What does MLOps stand for?
Ans. Machine Learning Operations
Explanation: MLOps stands for Machine Learning Operations, which refers to the practices and tools that operationalize the machine learning lifecycle.

Q2. Which stage involves converting a trained machine learning model into a form that can be used for making predictions?
Ans.Model Deployment 
Explanation: Model Deployment is the stage that involves converting a trained machine learning model into a form that can be used for making predictions.

Q3. What is the primary goal of MLOps?
Ans:Ensuring Model Reliability in Production
Explanation:The primary goal of MLOps is to enable the continuous integration and delivery of high-quality, reliable machine learning models into production.

Q4.Which tool is commonly used for managing and serving machine learning models in production?
Ans:Kubernetes
Explanation:Kubernetes is commonly used for managing and serving machine learning models in production due to its scalability and flexibility.

Q5.In MLOps, what is the purpose of feature engineering?
Ans:Transforming Data for Model Training
Explanation:Feature engineering aims to transform raw data into a format that is suitable for machine learning model training, thereby improving the model's performance.

Q6.What does CI/CD stand for in the context of MLOps?
Ans: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
Explanation:CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment, which emphasizes the automation and integration of various stages in the machine learning lifecycle.

Q7.What does A/B testing enable in the context of MLOps?
Ans:Performance Comparison of Model Versions
Explanation:A/B testing enables the comparison of different versions of a model or system, allowing for data-driven decisions on performance improvements before deploying changes to production.

Q7.What is the role of containerization in MLOps?
Ans:Consistent Deployment of Models
Explanation:Containerization enables consistent and reproducible deployment of machine learning models by encapsulating the model, its dependencies, and runtime environment.

Q8.What are the benefits of implementing a feature store in MLOps?
Ans:Centralized Feature Management
Explanation:A feature store centralizes the management of engineered features, improving data quality, consistency, and governance for model training and serving.

Q9.In MLOps, what does 'shift-left' refer to?
Ans:Early Integration of Key Considerations
Explanation:'Shift-left' refers to the practice of integrating and addressing key considerations, such as testing and security, earlier in the machine learning development lifecycle.

Q10.What does 'data drift' refer to in the context of MLOps?
Ans:Changes in Input Data Distribution
Explanation:'Data drift' refers to the changes in the input data distribution over time, which can significantly affect model performance and predictions.
